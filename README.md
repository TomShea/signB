# signB

This code adapts FastLED animations for the Ooligan Alley 'Emblem' sign.

Demonstrated here is the use of a simple PHP script to print a stupidly large array literal for pixel mapping
to an irregular shape. This has proven to be rather performant (~100 FPS on 1027 pixels across 6 pins), but I'd welcome any optimisation suggestions.
